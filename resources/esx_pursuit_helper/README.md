Pursuit Helper

Overview

StarChase is the trade name of a less-lethal vehicle tagging system developed early in 2006 to tag, track and locate a fleeing vehicle of interest to police. Its components consist of a tag, a small projectile with the end covered in a viscous adhesive which contains a GPS locator and a transmitter, fired by compressed air from a small launcher on the front grille of a police car.[1] The system was developed to reduce the need for, and the inherent danger of, high speed pursuits, many of which are precipitated by traffic violations where the motorist is later found to have outstanding business with the court system.

How To Use

Press M key to deploy the tracker into the vehicle right in front of you and again to kill the tracker.

Description

Main Features are..

- deployable GPS Tracker via action key,
- 4 stages of tracking and deployment:
  1. Deployed,
  2. GPS signal received,
  3. GPS tracker disabled,
  4. Signal lost.
- Automatic Report to all police officers via chasing marker on map and gps,
- Automatic Routing towards knowing GPS coordinate, not using the main waypoint marker,
- Sounds for all four stages including the actual sound that is being created when the tracker attaches to the vehicle.

The stages cannot be manually switched but activated and deactivated by the M key.

By deploying the GPS the program is waiting for a signal to receive.
And the same goes for losing a signal. Once the signal is lost it cannot be caught again.

The GPS signal will be receivable over the entire map.
Stage sounds are only hearable inside a police vehicle.

A video or pictures will follow as soon as I have done my preview stream tonight.
